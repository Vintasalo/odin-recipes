    <h2><strong>DIRECTIONS</strong></h2>
<ol>
    <h3><strong>Step 1</strong></h3>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
            Cook and stir beef and onion in the hot 
            skillet until beef is browned and crumbly 
            and onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. 
            Drain and discard grease.</li>
    <h3><strong>Step 2</strong></h3>    
        <li>Crush stewed tomatoes into smaller pieces 
            in a bowl, then pour into the skillet. 
            Stir in mushrooms, tomato sauce, olives, 
            garlic, salt, and pepper. Let simmer, uncovered, 
            until liquid reduces, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
    <h3><strong>Step 3</strong></h3>
        <li>Slice zucchini lengthwise, then cut crosswise 
            into 1/2-inch slices. Add zucchini to beef 
            mixture; cover and cook until zucchni is firm 
            yet tender to the bite, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir 
            in Cheddar cheese; cover and cook until 
            melted, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>         
</ol>

    <h3><strong>TIPS</strong></h3>
        <p><em>It seems like a lot of onions; however, as I said previously, 
               my wife loves this and she hates onions. The 
               onions meld well with the other ingredients and 
               are not a prominent taste in the dish. I wouldn't 
               make it without them!</em></p>
