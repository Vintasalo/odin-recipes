# odin-recipes
REF: 8_11_2023 HTML VSCODE PROJECT
This project was to demonstrate through html & Vcode the ability to incorporate images and descriptions. Also included was the linear sequence of being able to list ingrediants of recipes that are easy to read and understand

Towards the middle of the project I wanted to add more flare and center the main image and some text formatting. I was not taught this but wanted to extend my ability to google the additional formatting option and reflect more of the original webpage this was pulled from

This project was essential in the understanding of some basic html and my ability to work well with the git/github repositories. Also the redundency of makeing several pages/recipes was good in muscle memory

All in all a great and rewarding project; looking forward to the integration of CSS and improving the project
